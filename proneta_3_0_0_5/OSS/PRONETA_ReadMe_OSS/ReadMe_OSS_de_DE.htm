It also counts\u003cbr\u003eas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\u003cbr\u003ethe version number 2.1.]\u003cbr\u003ePreamble\u003cbr\u003eThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\u003cbr\u003efreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\u003cbr\u003eLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\u003cbr\u003efree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\u003cbr\u003eThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\u003cbr\u003especially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\u003cbr\u003eFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\u003cbr\u003ecan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\u003cbr\u003ethis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\u003cbr\u003estrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\u003cbr\u003eWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\u003cbr\u003enot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\u003cbr\u003eyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\u003cbr\u003efor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\u003cbr\u003eit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\u003cbr\u003eit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\u003cbr\u003ethese things.\u003cbr\u003eTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\u003cbr\u003edistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\u003cbr\u003erights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\u003cbr\u003eyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\u003cbr\u003eor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\u003cbr\u003eyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\u003cbr\u003ecode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\u003cbr\u003ecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\u003cbr\u003ewith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\u003cbr\u003eit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\u003cbr\u003eWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\u003cbr\u003elibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\u003cbr\u003epermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\u003cbr\u003eTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\u003cbr\u003ethere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\u003cbr\u003emodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\u003cbr\u003ethat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\u003cbr\u003eauthor\u0026#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\u003cbr\u003eintroduced by others.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\u003cbr\u003eany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\u003cbr\u003eeffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\u003cbr\u003erestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\u003cbr\u003eany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\u003cbr\u003econsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\u003cbr\u003eMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\u003cbr\u003eordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\u003cbr\u003eis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\u003cbr\u003ethis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\u003cbr\u003elibraries into non-free programs.\u003cbr\u003eWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\u003cbr\u003ea shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\u003cbr\u003ecombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\u003cbr\u003eentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\u003cbr\u003ePublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\u003cbr\u003ethe library.\u003cbr\u003eWe call this license the \u0026quot;Lesser\u0026quot; General Public License because it\u003cbr\u003edoes Less to protect the user\u0026#39;s freedom than the ordinary General\u003cbr\u003ePublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\u003cbr\u003eof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\u003cbr\u003eare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\u003cbr\u003elibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\u003cbr\u003especial circumstances.\u003cbr\u003eFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\u003cbr\u003eencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\u003cbr\u003ea de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\u003cbr\u003eallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\u003cbr\u003elibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\u003cbr\u003ecase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\u003cbr\u003esoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\u003cbr\u003eIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\u003cbr\u003eprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\u003cbr\u003efree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\u003cbr\u003enon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\u003cbr\u003eoperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\u003cbr\u003esystem.\u003cbr\u003eAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\u003cbr\u003eusers\u0026#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\u003cbr\u003elinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\u003cbr\u003ethat program using a modified version of the Library.\u003cbr\u003eThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\u003cbr\u003emodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\u003cbr\u003e\u0026quot;work based on the library\u0026quot; and a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;.  The\u003cbr\u003eformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\u003cbr\u003ebe combined with the library in order to run.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\u003cbr\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\u003cbr\u003eprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\u003cbr\u003eother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis Lesser General Public License (also called \u0026quot;this License\u0026quot;).\u003cbr\u003eEach licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003eA \u0026quot;library\u0026quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data\u003cbr\u003eprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\u003cbr\u003e(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\u003cbr\u003eThe \u0026quot;Library\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work\u003cbr\u003ewhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \u0026quot;work based on the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary\u0026quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under\u003cbr\u003ecopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\u003cbr\u003eportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\u003cbr\u003estraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\u003cbr\u003eincluded without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.)\u003cbr\u003e\u0026quot;Source code\u0026quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\u003cbr\u003eall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\u003cbr\u003einterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\u003cbr\u003eand installation of the library.\u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\u003cbr\u003ecovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\u003cbr\u003erunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\u003cbr\u003esuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\u003cbr\u003ewriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\u003cbr\u003eand what the program that uses the Library does.\u003cbr\u003e1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u0026#39;s\u003cbr\u003ecomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\u003cbr\u003eyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\u003cbr\u003eappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\u003cbr\u003eall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\u003cbr\u003ewarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary.\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\u003cbr\u003eand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\u003cbr\u003efee.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\u003cbr\u003eof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\u003cbr\u003edistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\u003cbr\u003eabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003ea) The modified work must itself be a software library.\u003cbr\u003eb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\u003cbr\u003estating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003ec) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\u003cbr\u003echarge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003ed) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\u003cbr\u003etable of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\u003cbr\u003ethe facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\u003cbr\u003eis invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\u003cbr\u003ein the event an application does not supply such function or\u003cbr\u003etable, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\u003cbr\u003eits purpose remains meaningful.\u003cbr\u003e(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\u003cbr\u003ea purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\u003cbr\u003eapplication.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\u003cbr\u003eapplication-supplied function or table used by this function must\u003cbr\u003ebe optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\u003cbr\u003eroot function must still compute square roots.)\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\u003cbr\u003eidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\u003cbr\u003eand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\u003cbr\u003ethemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\u003cbr\u003esections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\u003cbr\u003eit.\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Library.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\u003cbr\u003ewith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\u003cbr\u003eLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\u003cbr\u003ethis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\u003cbr\u003ethat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\u003cbr\u003einstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\u003cbr\u003eordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\u003cbr\u003ethat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\u003cbr\u003ethese notices.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\u003cbr\u003ethat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\u003cbr\u003esubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\u003cbr\u003eThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\u003cbr\u003ethe Library into a program that is not a library.\u003cbr\u003e4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\u003cbr\u003ederivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\u003cbr\u003eunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\u003cbr\u003eit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\u003cbr\u003emust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\u003cbr\u003emedium customarily used for software interchange.\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\u003cbr\u003efrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\u003cbr\u003esource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\u003cbr\u003edistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\u003cbr\u003elinked with it, is called a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;.  Such a\u003cbr\u003ework, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\u003cbr\u003etherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, linking a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library\u003cbr\u003ecreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\u003cbr\u003econtains portions of the Library), rather than a \u0026quot;work that uses the\u003cbr\u003elibrary\u0026quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\u003cbr\u003eSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\u003cbr\u003eWhen a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; uses material from a header file\u003cbr\u003ethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\u003cbr\u003ederivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\u003cbr\u003eWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\u003cbr\u003elinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\u003cbr\u003ethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\u003cbr\u003eIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\u003cbr\u003estructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\u003cbr\u003efunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\u003cbr\u003efile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\u003cbr\u003ework.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\u003cbr\u003eOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\u003cbr\u003edistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\u003cbr\u003eAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\u003cbr\u003ewhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\u003cbr\u003elink a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library to produce a\u003cbr\u003ework containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\u003cbr\u003eunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\u003cbr\u003emodification of the work for the customer\u0026#39;s own use and reverse\u003cbr\u003eengineering for debugging such modifications.\u003cbr\u003eYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\u003cbr\u003ethis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\u003cbr\u003eduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\u003cbr\u003ecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\u003cbr\u003edirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\u003cbr\u003eof these things:\u003cbr\u003ea) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\u003cbr\u003emachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\u003cbr\u003echanges were used in the work (which must be distributed under\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\u003cbr\u003ewith the Library, with the complete machine-readable \u0026quot;work that\u003cbr\u003euses the Library\u0026quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the\u003cbr\u003euser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\u003cbr\u003eexecutable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\u003cbr\u003ethat the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\u003cbr\u003eto use the modified definitions.)\u003cbr\u003eb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\u003cbr\u003ecopy of the library already present on the user\u0026#39;s computer system,\u003cbr\u003erather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\u003cbr\u003ewill operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\u003cbr\u003ethe user installs one, as long as the modified version is\u003cbr\u003einterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\u003cbr\u003ec) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\u003cbr\u003eleast three years, to give the same user the materials\u003cbr\u003especified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\u003cbr\u003ethan the cost of performing this distribution.\u003cbr\u003ed) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\u003cbr\u003efrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\u003cbr\u003especified materials from the same place.\u003cbr\u003ee) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\u003cbr\u003ematerials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\u003cbr\u003eFor an executable, the required form of the \u0026quot;work that uses the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary\u0026quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for\u003cbr\u003ereproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\u003cbr\u003ethe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\u003cbr\u003enormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\u003cbr\u003ecomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\u003cbr\u003ewhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\u003cbr\u003ethe executable.\u003cbr\u003eIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\u003cbr\u003erestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\u003cbr\u003eaccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\u003cbr\u003euse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\u003cbr\u003edistribute.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\u003cbr\u003efacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\u003cbr\u003elibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\u003cbr\u003ethe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\u003cbr\u003epermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\u003cbr\u003ea) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\u003cbr\u003ebased on the Library, uncombined with any other library\u003cbr\u003efacilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\u003cbr\u003eSections above.\u003cbr\u003eb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\u003cbr\u003ethat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\u003cbr\u003ewhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\u003cbr\u003e8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\u003cbr\u003ethe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\u003cbr\u003eattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\u003cbr\u003erights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\u003cbr\u003eor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\u003cbr\u003eterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Library or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\u003cbr\u003esubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\u003cbr\u003edistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\u003cbr\u003eLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\u003cbr\u003emay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\u003cbr\u003elicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\u003cbr\u003eall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\u003cbr\u003ethe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\u003cbr\u003erefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\u003cbr\u003eparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\u003cbr\u003eand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\u003cbr\u003epatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\u003cbr\u003esuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\u003cbr\u003eintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\u003cbr\u003eimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\u003cbr\u003egenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\u003cbr\u003ethrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\u003cbr\u003esystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\u003cbr\u003eto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\u003cbr\u003eimpose that choice.\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\u003cbr\u003ebe a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\u003cbr\u003ecertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\u003cbr\u003ean explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\u003cbr\u003eso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\u003cbr\u003eexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\u003cbr\u003ewritten in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\u003cbr\u003eversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\u003cbr\u003eSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\u003cbr\u003ebut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\u003cbr\u003especifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\u003cbr\u003e\u0026quot;any later version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and\u003cbr\u003econditions either of that version or of any later version published by\u003cbr\u003ethe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\u003cbr\u003elicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\u003cbr\u003ethe Free Software Foundation.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\u003cbr\u003eprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\u003cbr\u003ewrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\u003cbr\u003ecopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\u003cbr\u003edecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\u003cbr\u003eof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\u003cbr\u003eand reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003eNO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\u003cbr\u003eWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\u003cbr\u003eEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\u003cbr\u003eOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \u0026quot;AS IS\u0026quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\u003cbr\u003eKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\u003cbr\u003eIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\u003cbr\u003ePURPOSE.

And you must show them these terms so they know their\u003cbr\u003erights.\u003cbr\u003e  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\u003cbr\u003e(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\u003cbr\u003edistribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e  Also, for each author\u0026#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\u003cbr\u003ethat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\u003cbr\u003esoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\u003cbr\u003ewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\u003cbr\u003ethat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\u003cbr\u003eauthors\u0026#39; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\u003cbr\u003epatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\u003cbr\u003eprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\u003cbr\u003eprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\u003cbr\u003epatent must be licensed for everyone\u0026#39;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\u003cbr\u003emodification follow.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\u003cbr\u003e   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\u003cbr\u003ea notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\u003cbr\u003eunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \u0026quot;Program\u0026quot;, below,\u003cbr\u003erefers to any such program or work, and a \u0026quot;work based on the Program\u0026quot;\u003cbr\u003emeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\u003cbr\u003ethat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\u003cbr\u003eeither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\u003cbr\u003elanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\u003cbr\u003ethe term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\u003cbr\u003ecovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\u003cbr\u003erunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\u003cbr\u003eis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\u003cbr\u003eWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026#39;s\u003cbr\u003esource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\u003cbr\u003econspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\u003cbr\u003ecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\u003cbr\u003enotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\u003cbr\u003eand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\u003cbr\u003ealong with the Program.\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\u003cbr\u003eyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\u003cbr\u003eof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\u003cbr\u003edistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\u003cbr\u003eabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\u003cbr\u003e    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\u003cbr\u003e    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\u003cbr\u003e    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\u003cbr\u003e    parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003e    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\u003cbr\u003e    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\u003cbr\u003e    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\u003cbr\u003e    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\u003cbr\u003e    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\u003cbr\u003e    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\u003cbr\u003e    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\u003cbr\u003e    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\u003cbr\u003e    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\u003cbr\u003e    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\u003cbr\u003eidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\u003cbr\u003eand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\u003cbr\u003ethemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\u003cbr\u003esections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\u003cbr\u003ewith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\u003cbr\u003eunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\u003cbr\u003e    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\u003cbr\u003e    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\u003cbr\u003e    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\u003cbr\u003e    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\u003cbr\u003e    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\u003cbr\u003e    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\u003cbr\u003e    customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\u003cbr\u003e    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\u003cbr\u003e    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\u003cbr\u003e    received the program in object code or executable form with such\u003cbr\u003e    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\u003cbr\u003ecode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\u003cbr\u003eassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\u003cbr\u003econtrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\u003cbr\u003especial exception, the source code distributed need not include\u003cbr\u003eanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\u003cbr\u003eform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\u003cbr\u003eoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\u003cbr\u003eitself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\u003cbr\u003edistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\u003cbr\u003eexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\u003cbr\u003eotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\u003cbr\u003evoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\u003cbr\u003ethis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\u003cbr\u003eparties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\u003cbr\u003ethese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\u003cbr\u003edistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\u003cbr\u003eLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\u003cbr\u003emay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\u003cbr\u003elicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\u003cbr\u003eall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\u003cbr\u003ethe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\u003cbr\u003erefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\u003cbr\u003eany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\u003cbr\u003eapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\u003cbr\u003ecircumstances.\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\u003cbr\u003epatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\u003cbr\u003esuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\u003cbr\u003eintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\u003cbr\u003eimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\u003cbr\u003egenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\u003cbr\u003ethrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\u003cbr\u003esystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\u003cbr\u003eto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\u003cbr\u003eimpose that choice.\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\u003cbr\u003ebe a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\u003cbr\u003ecertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\u003cbr\u003emay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\u003cbr\u003ethose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\u003cbr\u003ecountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\u003cbr\u003ethe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\u003cbr\u003eof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\u003cbr\u003ebe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\u003cbr\u003eaddress new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\u003cbr\u003especifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any\u003cbr\u003elater version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\u003cbr\u003eeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation.\u003cbr\u003e  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\u003cbr\u003eprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\u003cbr\u003eto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\u003cbr\u003emake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\u003cbr\u003eof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\u003cbr\u003eof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003eFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\u003cbr\u003eOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\u003cbr\u003ePROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u0026quot;AS IS\u0026quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\u003cbr\u003eOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\u003cbr\u003eMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\u003cbr\u003eTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\u003cbr\u003ePROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\u003cbr\u003eREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\u003cbr\u003e  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\u003cbr\u003eWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\u003cbr\u003eREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\u003cbr\u003eINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\u003cbr\u003eOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\u003cbr\u003eTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\u003cbr\u003eYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\u003cbr\u003ePROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\u003cbr\u003ePOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\u003cbr\u003e\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\u003cbr\u003e  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\u003cbr\u003epossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\u003cbr\u003efree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\u003cbr\u003e  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\u003cbr\u003eto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\u003cbr\u003econvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\u003cbr\u003ethe \u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\u003cbr\u003e    \u0026lt;one line to give the program\u0026#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e    Copyright (C) \u0026lt;year\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;name of author\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\u003cbr\u003e    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\u003cbr\u003e    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\u003cbr\u003e    (at your option) any later version.\u003cbr\u003e    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\u003cbr\u003e    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\u003cbr\u003e    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb.

The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. Termination\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ea. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. Miscellaneous\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ea. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ec. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ed. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ee. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e201011\u003cbr\u003e"},{"comment":"Generated by Notices Utility for Mainline CLI","id":"Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)","name":"Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)","licenseText":"\u003ch1\u003eMicrosoft Public License (Ms-PL)\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e// (c) Copyright Microsoft Corporation.\u003cbr\u003e// This source is subject to the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL).\u003cbr\u003e// Please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID\u003d131993 for details.\u003cbr\u003e// All other rights reserved.\u003cbr\u003e--\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;UserControl \u003cbr\u003e    x:Class\u003d\u0026quot;Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing.Client.ClassicTestPage\u0026quot; \u003cbr\u003e    xmlns\u003d\u0026quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\u0026quot; \u003cbr\u003e    xmlns:x\u003d\u0026quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e    \u0026lt;Grid x:Name\u003d\u0026quot;TestLayoutRoot\u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;/UserControl\u0026gt;!í   ï»¿\u0026lt;!--\u003cbr\u003e// (c) Copyright Microsoft Corporation.\u003cbr\u003e// This source is subject to the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL).\u003cbr\u003e// Please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID\u003d131993 for details.\u003cbr\u003e// All other rights reserved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMicrosoft Public License (Ms-PL)\u003cbr\u003eThis license governs use of the accompanying software.

(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\u003cbr\u003ethe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\u003cbr\u003eyour programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\u003cbr\u003eprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\u003cbr\u003ehave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\u003cbr\u003ethis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\u003cbr\u003eif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\u003cbr\u003ein new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\u003cbr\u003eanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\u003cbr\u003eThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\u003cbr\u003edistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\u003cbr\u003egratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\u003cbr\u003eyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\u003cbr\u003esource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\u003cbr\u003erights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\u003cbr\u003e(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\u003cbr\u003edistribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Also, for each author\u0026#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\u003cbr\u003ethat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\u003cbr\u003esoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\u003cbr\u003ewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\u003cbr\u003ethat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\u003cbr\u003eauthors\u0026#39; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\u003cbr\u003epatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\u003cbr\u003eprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\u003cbr\u003eprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\u003cbr\u003epatent must be licensed for everyone\u0026#39;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\u003cbr\u003emodification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\u003cbr\u003e   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  0.

If\u003cbr\u003eidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\u003cbr\u003eand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\u003cbr\u003ethemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\u003cbr\u003esections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\u003cbr\u003ewith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\u003cbr\u003eunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\u003cbr\u003e    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\u003cbr\u003e    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\u003cbr\u003e    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\u003cbr\u003e    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\u003cbr\u003e    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\u003cbr\u003e    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\u003cbr\u003e    customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\u003cbr\u003e    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\u003cbr\u003e    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\u003cbr\u003e    received the program in object code or executable form with such\u003cbr\u003e    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\u003cbr\u003ecode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\u003cbr\u003eassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\u003cbr\u003econtrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\u003cbr\u003especial exception, the source code distributed need not include\u003cbr\u003eanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\u003cbr\u003eform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\u003cbr\u003eoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\u003cbr\u003eitself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\u003cbr\u003edistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\u003cbr\u003eexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\u003cbr\u003eotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\u003cbr\u003evoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\u003cbr\u003ethis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\u003cbr\u003eparties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\u003cbr\u003ethese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\u003cbr\u003edistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\u003cbr\u003eLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\u003cbr\u003emay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\u003cbr\u003elicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\u003cbr\u003eall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\u003cbr\u003ethe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\u003cbr\u003erefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\u003cbr\u003eany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\u003cbr\u003eapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\u003cbr\u003ecircumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\u003cbr\u003epatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\u003cbr\u003esuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\u003cbr\u003eintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\u003cbr\u003eimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\u003cbr\u003egenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\u003cbr\u003ethrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\u003cbr\u003esystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\u003cbr\u003eto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\u003cbr\u003eimpose that choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\u003cbr\u003ebe a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\u003cbr\u003ecertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\u003cbr\u003emay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\u003cbr\u003ethose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\u003cbr\u003ecountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\u003cbr\u003ethe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\u003cbr\u003eof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\u003cbr\u003ebe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\u003cbr\u003eaddress new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\u003cbr\u003especifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any\u003cbr\u003elater version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\u003cbr\u003eeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\u003cbr\u003eprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\u003cbr\u003eto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\u003cbr\u003emake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\u003cbr\u003eof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\u003cbr\u003eof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e                            NO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  11.

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\u003cbr\u003ehave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\u003cbr\u003ethis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\u003cbr\u003eif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\u003cbr\u003ein new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\u003cbr\u003eanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\u003cbr\u003eThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\u003cbr\u003edistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\u003cbr\u003egratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\u003cbr\u003eyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\u003cbr\u003esource code.

We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\u003cbr\u003eprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\u003cbr\u003eprogram proprietary.

But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\u003cbr\u003ewith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\u003cbr\u003eunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\u003cbr\u003e    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\u003cbr\u003e    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\u003cbr\u003e    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\u003cbr\u003e    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\u003cbr\u003e    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\u003cbr\u003e    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\u003cbr\u003e    customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\u003cbr\u003e    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\u003cbr\u003e    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\u003cbr\u003e    received the program in object code or executable form with such\u003cbr\u003e    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\u003cbr\u003ecode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\u003cbr\u003eassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\u003cbr\u003econtrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\u003cbr\u003especial exception, the source code distributed need not include\u003cbr\u003eanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\u003cbr\u003eform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\u003cbr\u003eoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\u003cbr\u003eitself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\u003cbr\u003edistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\u003cbr\u003eexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\u003cbr\u003eotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\u003cbr\u003evoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\u003cbr\u003ethis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\u003cbr\u003eparties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\u003cbr\u003ethese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\u003cbr\u003edistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\u003cbr\u003eLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\u003cbr\u003emay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\u003cbr\u003elicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\u003cbr\u003eall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\u003cbr\u003ethe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\u003cbr\u003erefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\u003cbr\u003eany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\u003cbr\u003eapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\u003cbr\u003ecircumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\u003cbr\u003epatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\u003cbr\u003esuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\u003cbr\u003eintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\u003cbr\u003eimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\u003cbr\u003egenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\u003cbr\u003ethrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\u003cbr\u003esystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\u003cbr\u003eto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\u003cbr\u003eimpose that choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\u003cbr\u003ebe a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\u003cbr\u003ecertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\u003cbr\u003emay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\u003cbr\u003ethose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\u003cbr\u003ecountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\u003cbr\u003ethe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\u003cbr\u003eof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\u003cbr\u003ebe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\u003cbr\u003eaddress new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\u003cbr\u003especifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any\u003cbr\u003elater version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\u003cbr\u003eeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation.

For software which is copyrighted by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\u003cbr\u003emake exceptions for this.

We had the following goals in mind (not in order of preference): \r\n\u003c/dl\u003e\r\n\u003col\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eClear\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eLots of questions get asked about \u0027can I include Tomcat/Jserv/xxx in my commercial product,\u0027 even though *careful* reading of the current license answers that. It may be better to be verbose if that cuts down on frequently asked questions. Likewise, many lawyers have commented that the original license did not define the terminology precisely. Solved in 2.0 by defining most important terms and separating the permissions into identifiable sections.\u003c/i\u003e \r\n\u003cli\u003eReusable\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eThe Apache- and ASF project-specific stuff should be separated out of the license proper so that both ASF and non-ASF projects can use the license terms unaltered. Currently, each ASF project has its own, altered, version of the main ASF 1.1 license template. Solved in 2.0 by moving project-specific stuff into the NOTICE file.\u003c/i\u003e \r\n\u003cli\u003eTrademarks\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eAvoid listing a specific set of trade marks, trade names, and service marks within the license, since that caused problems with project-specific licenses and apparent GPL-compatibility. Likewise, provide instruction on how and when Apache marks may or may not be used, since that is our most common source of licensing question. Partly solved in 2.0 by excluding any permission to use trademarks within the license itself and moving related information into the NOTICE file.\u003c/i\u003e \r\n\u003cli\u003eCompatible with other licenses\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eSince the ASF aims to create software that implements reference standards, it\u0027s in the interests of the ASF and ASF software users to aim for \u0026quot;compatibility\u0026quot; with other widely used software licenses, where \u0026quot;compatibility\u0026quot; means that our software can be used and redistributed as part of a combined work. Special preference should be given to other widely-used open source licenses, to help avoid reinvention of the wheel. Partly solved in 2.0 by modifying trademark clause and moving attribution notices into the NOTICE file.\u003c/i\u003e \r\n\u003cli\u003ePatent protection.\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eIt would be nice to have some language in the license that protected us and our users from patent-infringement suits, at the very least from contributors if not in more general ways. Solved in 2.0.\u003c/i\u003e \r\n\u003cli\u003eCovers contributions\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eHow do we ensure that contributions are made under our license and not under some other conditions? Solved in 2.0.\u003c/i\u003e \r\n\u003cli\u003eApplicable to documentation\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eMake the license clearly applicable to both software and documentation. Solved in 2.0.\u003c/i\u003e \r\n\u003cli\u003eIncludable by reference\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eWe should be able to replace all the copies of the license in our files with pointers to a license file and/or a URL. And the license should state that this can be done, and define the conditions.

Less than a page is excellent; shorter still is even better. This is the trade-off -- we lost shortness in exchange for more clarity and extra patent and contribution coverage. However, the 2.0 license is still considerably shorter than comparative licenses, and the ability to license by reference makes the actual citations within source files much shorter than before.\u003c/i\u003e \r\n\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cfont size\u003d2\u003e\u003ci\u003eCopyright \u0026copy; 1999-2004, The Apache Software Foundation\u003c/i\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003c/font\u003e","id":"Apache20","name":"Apache License 2.0"},{"id":"c_bsd3-clauselicensevariantjcraftinc_5228","name":"BSD 3-Clause License / Variant JCRAFT, Inc"}],"effectiveCustomAcknowledgements":"    DotNetZip - Copyright (c) 2006 - 2011 Dino Chiesa \n    DotNetZip - Copyright (c) 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 Dino Chiesa and Microsoft Corporation. \n     \n    jzlib - Copyright (c) 2000,2001,2002,2003 ymnk, JCraft, Inc.\n    zlib - Copyright (c) 1995-2004 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler\n     \n    Apache Commons Compress - Copyright 2002-2014 The Apache Software Foundation\n    This product includes software developed at The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).\n    The files in the package org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz were derived from the LZMA SDK, version 9.20 (C/ and CPP/7zip/), which has been placed in the public domain:\n    %22LZMA SDK is placed in the public domain.%22 (http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html)\n     \n    Many thanks to Tim Endres, Keiron Liddle, and (for libbzip2), Julian Seward at bzip.org.\n\n    Apache Commons Compress\n    Copyright 2002-2010 The Apache Software Foundation\n     \n    This product includes software developed by\n    The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).\n","linkToDetailText":"LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT INFORMATION FOR COMPONENT DOTNETZIP - MASTER 1.11.0 (COMMIT #124)","detailSectionHeader":"LICENSE CONDITIONS AND COPYRIGHT NOTICES"}],"applicationLicenses":{"c_bsd3-clauselicensevarianttheprojectandcontributors_5153":"Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:  \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e1.Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e2.Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e3.Neither the name of the project nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE PROJECT AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\u003cbr\u003eLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\u003cbr\u003esoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation\u0026apos;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to\u003cbr\u003eusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\u003cbr\u003ethe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\u003cbr\u003eyour programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\u003cbr\u003eprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\u003cbr\u003ehave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\u003cbr\u003ethis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\u003cbr\u003eif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\u003cbr\u003ein new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\u003cbr\u003eanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\u003cbr\u003eThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\u003cbr\u003edistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\u003cbr\u003egratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\u003cbr\u003eyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\u003cbr\u003esource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\u003cbr\u003erights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\u003cbr\u003e(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\u003cbr\u003edistribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Also, for each author\u0026apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\u003cbr\u003ethat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\u003cbr\u003esoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\u003cbr\u003ewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\u003cbr\u003ethat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\u003cbr\u003eauthors\u0026apos; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\u003cbr\u003epatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\u003cbr\u003eprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\u003cbr\u003eprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\u003cbr\u003epatent must be licensed for everyone\u0026apos;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\u003cbr\u003emodification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\u003cbr\u003e   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  0.

The act of\u003cbr\u003erunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\u003cbr\u003eis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\u003cbr\u003eWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026apos;s\u003cbr\u003esource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\u003cbr\u003econspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\u003cbr\u003ecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\u003cbr\u003enotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\u003cbr\u003eand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\u003cbr\u003ealong with the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\u003cbr\u003eyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\u003cbr\u003eof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\u003cbr\u003edistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\u003cbr\u003eabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\u003cbr\u003e    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\u003cbr\u003e    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\u003cbr\u003e    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\u003cbr\u003e    parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\u003cbr\u003e    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\u003cbr\u003e    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\u003cbr\u003e    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\u003cbr\u003e    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\u003cbr\u003e    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\u003cbr\u003e    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\u003cbr\u003e    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\u003cbr\u003e    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\u003cbr\u003e    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\u003cbr\u003eidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\u003cbr\u003eand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\u003cbr\u003ethemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\u003cbr\u003esections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\u003cbr\u003ewith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\u003cbr\u003eunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\u003cbr\u003e    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\u003cbr\u003e    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\u003cbr\u003e    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\u003cbr\u003e    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\u003cbr\u003e    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\u003cbr\u003e    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\u003cbr\u003e    customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\u003cbr\u003e    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\u003cbr\u003e    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\u003cbr\u003e    received the program in object code or executable form with such\u003cbr\u003e    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\u003cbr\u003ecode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\u003cbr\u003eassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\u003cbr\u003econtrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\u003cbr\u003especial exception, the source code distributed need not include\u003cbr\u003eanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\u003cbr\u003eform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\u003cbr\u003eoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\u003cbr\u003eitself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\u003cbr\u003edistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\u003cbr\u003eexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\u003cbr\u003eotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\u003cbr\u003evoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\u003cbr\u003ethis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\u003cbr\u003eparties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\u003cbr\u003ethese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.

It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePreamble\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to other libraries whose authors who decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries too. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAlso, for each distributor\u0027s protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don\u0027t assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u0027s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ea) The modified work must itself be a software library. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ec) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ed) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\u0027s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ea) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eb) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ec) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ed) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ea) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0027 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eNO WARRANTY \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e15.

You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8.

If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ed. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ee. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\u003cbr\u003eLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\u003cbr\u003esoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation\u0026#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to\u003cbr\u003eusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\u003cbr\u003ethe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\u003cbr\u003eyour programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\u003cbr\u003eprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\u003cbr\u003ehave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\u003cbr\u003ethis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\u003cbr\u003eif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\u003cbr\u003ein new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\u003cbr\u003eanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\u003cbr\u003eThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\u003cbr\u003edistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\u003cbr\u003egratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\u003cbr\u003eyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\u003cbr\u003esource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\u003cbr\u003erights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\u003cbr\u003e(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\u003cbr\u003edistribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Also, for each author\u0026#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\u003cbr\u003ethat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\u003cbr\u003esoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\u003cbr\u003ewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\u003cbr\u003ethat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\u003cbr\u003eauthors\u0026#39; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\u003cbr\u003epatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\u003cbr\u003eprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\u003cbr\u003eprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\u003cbr\u003epatent must be licensed for everyone\u0026#39;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\u003cbr\u003emodification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\u003cbr\u003e   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  0.

The act of\u003cbr\u003erunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\u003cbr\u003eis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\u003cbr\u003eWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026#39;s\u003cbr\u003esource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\u003cbr\u003econspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\u003cbr\u003ecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\u003cbr\u003enotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\u003cbr\u003eand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\u003cbr\u003ealong with the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\u003cbr\u003eyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\u003cbr\u003eof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\u003cbr\u003edistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\u003cbr\u003eabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\u003cbr\u003e    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\u003cbr\u003e    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\u003cbr\u003e    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\u003cbr\u003e    parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\u003cbr\u003e    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\u003cbr\u003e    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\u003cbr\u003e    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\u003cbr\u003e    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\u003cbr\u003e    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\u003cbr\u003e    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\u003cbr\u003e    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\u003cbr\u003e    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\u003cbr\u003e    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\u003cbr\u003eidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\u003cbr\u003eand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\u003cbr\u003ethemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\u003cbr\u003esections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\u003cbr\u003ewith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\u003cbr\u003eunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\u003cbr\u003e    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\u003cbr\u003e    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\u003cbr\u003e    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\u003cbr\u003e    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\u003cbr\u003e    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\u003cbr\u003e    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\u003cbr\u003e    customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\u003cbr\u003e    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\u003cbr\u003e    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\u003cbr\u003e    received the program in object code or executable form with such\u003cbr\u003e    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\u003cbr\u003ecode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\u003cbr\u003eassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\u003cbr\u003econtrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\u003cbr\u003especial exception, the source code distributed need not include\u003cbr\u003eanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\u003cbr\u003eform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\u003cbr\u003eoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\u003cbr\u003eitself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\u003cbr\u003edistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\u003cbr\u003eexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\u003cbr\u003eotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\u003cbr\u003evoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\u003cbr\u003ethis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\u003cbr\u003eparties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\u003cbr\u003ethese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\u003cbr\u003edistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\u003cbr\u003eLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\u003cbr\u003emay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\u003cbr\u003elicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\u003cbr\u003eall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\u003cbr\u003ethe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\u003cbr\u003erefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\u003cbr\u003eany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\u003cbr\u003eapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\u003cbr\u003ecircumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\u003cbr\u003epatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\u003cbr\u003esuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\u003cbr\u003eintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\u003cbr\u003eimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\u003cbr\u003egenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\u003cbr\u003ethrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\u003cbr\u003esystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\u003cbr\u003eto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\u003cbr\u003eimpose that choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\u003cbr\u003ebe a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\u003cbr\u003ecertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\u003cbr\u003emay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\u003cbr\u003ethose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\u003cbr\u003ecountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\u003cbr\u003ethe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\u003cbr\u003eof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\u003cbr\u003ebe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\u003cbr\u003eaddress new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\u003cbr\u003especifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any\u003cbr\u003elater version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\u003cbr\u003eeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\u003cbr\u003eprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\u003cbr\u003eto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\u003cbr\u003emake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\u003cbr\u003eof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\u003cbr\u003eof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e                            NO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  11.

The systematic\r\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\r\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAlso, for each author\u0027s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0027s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAccompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAccompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0027 exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eNO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eone line to give the program\u0027s name and a brief idea of what it does.\u003cbr\u003eCopyright (C)\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\u003cbr\u003emodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\u003cbr\u003eas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\u003cbr\u003eof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\u003cbr\u003ebut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\u003cbr\u003eMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\u003cbr\u003eLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\u003cbr\u003esoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation\u0026#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to\u003cbr\u003eusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\u003cbr\u003ethe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\u003cbr\u003eyour programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\u003cbr\u003eprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\u003cbr\u003ehave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\u003cbr\u003ethis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\u003cbr\u003eif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\u003cbr\u003ein new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\u003cbr\u003eanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\u003cbr\u003eThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\u003cbr\u003edistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\u003cbr\u003egratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\u003cbr\u003eyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\u003cbr\u003esource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\u003cbr\u003erights.\u003cbr\u003e  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\u003cbr\u003e(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\u003cbr\u003edistribute and/or modify the software.\u003cbr\u003e  Also, for each author\u0026#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain\u003cbr\u003ethat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\u003cbr\u003esoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\u003cbr\u003ewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\u003cbr\u003ethat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\u003cbr\u003eauthors\u0026#39; reputations.\u003cbr\u003e  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\u003cbr\u003epatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\u003cbr\u003eprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\u003cbr\u003eprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\u003cbr\u003epatent must be licensed for everyone\u0026#39;s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\u003cbr\u003emodification follow.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\u003cbr\u003e   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\u003cbr\u003ea notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\u003cbr\u003eunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \u0026quot;Program\u0026quot;, below,\u003cbr\u003erefers to any such program or work, and a \u0026quot;work based on the Program\u0026quot;\u003cbr\u003emeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\u003cbr\u003ethat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\u003cbr\u003eeither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\u003cbr\u003elanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\u003cbr\u003ethe term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\u003cbr\u003ecovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\u003cbr\u003erunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\u003cbr\u003eis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\u003cbr\u003eWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\u003cbr\u003e  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026#39;s\u003cbr\u003esource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\u003cbr\u003econspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\u003cbr\u003ecopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\u003cbr\u003enotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\u003cbr\u003eand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\u003cbr\u003ealong with the Program.\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\u003cbr\u003eyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\u003cbr\u003e  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\u003cbr\u003eof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\u003cbr\u003edistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\u003cbr\u003eabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003e    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\u003cbr\u003e    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003e    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\u003cbr\u003e    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\u003cbr\u003e    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\u003cbr\u003e    parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003e    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\u003cbr\u003e    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\u003cbr\u003e    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\u003cbr\u003e    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\u003cbr\u003e    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\u003cbr\u003e    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\u003cbr\u003e    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\u003cbr\u003e    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\u003cbr\u003e    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\u003cbr\u003e    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\u003cbr\u003eidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\u003cbr\u003eand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\u003cbr\u003ethemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\u003cbr\u003esections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Program.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\u003cbr\u003ewith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\u003cbr\u003eunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\u003cbr\u003e    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\u003cbr\u003e    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\u003cbr\u003e    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\u003cbr\u003e    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\u003cbr\u003e    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\u003cbr\u003e    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\u003cbr\u003e    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\u003cbr\u003e    customarily used for software interchange; or,\u003cbr\u003e    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\u003cbr\u003e    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\u003cbr\u003e    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\u003cbr\u003e    received the program in object code or executable form with such\u003cbr\u003e    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\u003cbr\u003eThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\u003cbr\u003ecode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\u003cbr\u003eassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\u003cbr\u003econtrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\u003cbr\u003especial exception, the source code distributed need not include\u003cbr\u003eanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\u003cbr\u003eform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\u003cbr\u003eoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\u003cbr\u003eitself accompanies the executable.\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\u003cbr\u003eaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\u003cbr\u003edistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\u003cbr\u003eexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\u003cbr\u003eotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\u003cbr\u003evoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\u003cbr\u003ethis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\u003cbr\u003eparties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Program or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\u003cbr\u003ethese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\u003cbr\u003edistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\u003cbr\u003eLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\u003cbr\u003emay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\u003cbr\u003elicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\u003cbr\u003eall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\u003cbr\u003ethe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\u003cbr\u003erefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\u003cbr\u003eany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\u003cbr\u003eapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\u003cbr\u003ecircumstances.\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\u003cbr\u003epatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\u003cbr\u003esuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\u003cbr\u003eintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\u003cbr\u003eimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\u003cbr\u003egenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\u003cbr\u003ethrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\u003cbr\u003esystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\u003cbr\u003eto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\u003cbr\u003eimpose that choice.\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\u003cbr\u003ebe a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\u003cbr\u003ecertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\u003cbr\u003emay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\u003cbr\u003ethose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\u003cbr\u003ecountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\u003cbr\u003ethe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\u003cbr\u003eof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\u003cbr\u003ebe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\u003cbr\u003eaddress new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\u003cbr\u003especifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026quot;any\u003cbr\u003elater version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\u003cbr\u003eeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\u003cbr\u003eFoundation.\u003cbr\u003e  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\u003cbr\u003eprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\u003cbr\u003eto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\u003cbr\u003emake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\u003cbr\u003eof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\u003cbr\u003eof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003eFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\u003cbr\u003eLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\u003cbr\u003efree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\u003cbr\u003eThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\u003cbr\u003especially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\u003cbr\u003eFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\u003cbr\u003ecan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\u003cbr\u003ethis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\u003cbr\u003estrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\u003cbr\u003eWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\u003cbr\u003enot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\u003cbr\u003eyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\u003cbr\u003efor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\u003cbr\u003eit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\u003cbr\u003eit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\u003cbr\u003ethese things.\u003cbr\u003eTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\u003cbr\u003edistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\u003cbr\u003erights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\u003cbr\u003eyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\u003cbr\u003eor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\u003cbr\u003eyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\u003cbr\u003ecode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\u003cbr\u003ecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\u003cbr\u003ewith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\u003cbr\u003eit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\u003cbr\u003eWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\u003cbr\u003elibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\u003cbr\u003epermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\u003cbr\u003eTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\u003cbr\u003ethere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\u003cbr\u003emodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\u003cbr\u003ethat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\u003cbr\u003eauthor\u0026#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\u003cbr\u003eintroduced by others.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\u003cbr\u003eany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\u003cbr\u003eeffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\u003cbr\u003erestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\u003cbr\u003eany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\u003cbr\u003econsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\u003cbr\u003eMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\u003cbr\u003eordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\u003cbr\u003eis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\u003cbr\u003ethis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\u003cbr\u003elibraries into non-free programs.\u003cbr\u003eWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\u003cbr\u003ea shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\u003cbr\u003ecombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\u003cbr\u003eentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\u003cbr\u003ePublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\u003cbr\u003ethe library.\u003cbr\u003eWe call this license the \u0026quot;Lesser\u0026quot; General Public License because it\u003cbr\u003edoes Less to protect the user\u0026#39;s freedom than the ordinary General\u003cbr\u003ePublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\u003cbr\u003eof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\u003cbr\u003eare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\u003cbr\u003elibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\u003cbr\u003especial circumstances.\u003cbr\u003eFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\u003cbr\u003eencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\u003cbr\u003ea de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\u003cbr\u003eallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\u003cbr\u003elibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\u003cbr\u003ecase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\u003cbr\u003esoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\u003cbr\u003eIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\u003cbr\u003eprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\u003cbr\u003efree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\u003cbr\u003enon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\u003cbr\u003eoperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\u003cbr\u003esystem.\u003cbr\u003eAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\u003cbr\u003eusers\u0026#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\u003cbr\u003elinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\u003cbr\u003ethat program using a modified version of the Library.\u003cbr\u003eThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\u003cbr\u003emodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\u003cbr\u003e\u0026quot;work based on the library\u0026quot; and a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;.  The\u003cbr\u003eformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\u003cbr\u003ebe combined with the library in order to run.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\u003cbr\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003cbr\u003e0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\u003cbr\u003eprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\u003cbr\u003eother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis Lesser General Public License (also called \u0026quot;this License\u0026quot;).\u003cbr\u003eEach licensee is addressed as \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003eA \u0026quot;library\u0026quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data\u003cbr\u003eprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\u003cbr\u003e(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\u003cbr\u003eThe \u0026quot;Library\u0026quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work\u003cbr\u003ewhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \u0026quot;work based on the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary\u0026quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under\u003cbr\u003ecopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\u003cbr\u003eportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\u003cbr\u003estraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\u003cbr\u003eincluded without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.)\u003cbr\u003e\u0026quot;Source code\u0026quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for\u003cbr\u003emaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\u003cbr\u003eall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\u003cbr\u003einterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\u003cbr\u003eand installation of the library.\u003cbr\u003eActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\u003cbr\u003ecovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\u003cbr\u003erunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\u003cbr\u003esuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\u003cbr\u003ewriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\u003cbr\u003eand what the program that uses the Library does.\u003cbr\u003e1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\u0026#39;s\u003cbr\u003ecomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\u003cbr\u003eyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\u003cbr\u003eappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\u003cbr\u003eall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\u003cbr\u003ewarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary.\u003cbr\u003eYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\u003cbr\u003eand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\u003cbr\u003efee.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\u003cbr\u003eof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\u003cbr\u003edistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\u003cbr\u003eabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\u003cbr\u003ea) The modified work must itself be a software library.\u003cbr\u003eb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\u003cbr\u003estating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\u003cbr\u003ec) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\u003cbr\u003echarge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\u003cbr\u003ed) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\u003cbr\u003etable of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\u003cbr\u003ethe facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\u003cbr\u003eis invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\u003cbr\u003ein the event an application does not supply such function or\u003cbr\u003etable, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\u003cbr\u003eits purpose remains meaningful.\u003cbr\u003e(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\u003cbr\u003ea purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\u003cbr\u003eapplication.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\u003cbr\u003eapplication-supplied function or table used by this function must\u003cbr\u003ebe optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\u003cbr\u003eroot function must still compute square roots.)\u003cbr\u003eThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\u003cbr\u003eidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\u003cbr\u003eand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\u003cbr\u003ethemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\u003cbr\u003esections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\u003cbr\u003edistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\u003cbr\u003eon the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\u003cbr\u003ethis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\u003cbr\u003eentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\u003cbr\u003eit.\u003cbr\u003eThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\u003cbr\u003eyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\u003cbr\u003eexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\u003cbr\u003ecollective works based on the Library.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\u003cbr\u003ewith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\u003cbr\u003ea storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\u003cbr\u003ethe scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003e3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\u003cbr\u003eLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\u003cbr\u003ethis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\u003cbr\u003ethat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\u003cbr\u003einstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\u003cbr\u003eordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\u003cbr\u003ethat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\u003cbr\u003ethese notices.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\u003cbr\u003ethat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\u003cbr\u003esubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\u003cbr\u003eThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\u003cbr\u003ethe Library into a program that is not a library.\u003cbr\u003e4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\u003cbr\u003ederivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\u003cbr\u003eunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\u003cbr\u003eit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\u003cbr\u003emust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\u003cbr\u003emedium customarily used for software interchange.\u003cbr\u003eIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\u003cbr\u003efrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\u003cbr\u003esource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\u003cbr\u003edistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\u003cbr\u003ecompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\u003cbr\u003e5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\u003cbr\u003elinked with it, is called a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot;.  Such a\u003cbr\u003ework, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\u003cbr\u003etherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, linking a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library\u003cbr\u003ecreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\u003cbr\u003econtains portions of the Library), rather than a \u0026quot;work that uses the\u003cbr\u003elibrary\u0026quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\u003cbr\u003eSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\u003cbr\u003eWhen a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; uses material from a header file\u003cbr\u003ethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\u003cbr\u003ederivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\u003cbr\u003eWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\u003cbr\u003elinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\u003cbr\u003ethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\u003cbr\u003eIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\u003cbr\u003estructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\u003cbr\u003efunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\u003cbr\u003efile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\u003cbr\u003ework.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\u003cbr\u003eOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\u003cbr\u003edistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\u003cbr\u003eAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\u003cbr\u003ewhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\u003cbr\u003elink a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library\u0026quot; with the Library to produce a\u003cbr\u003ework containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\u003cbr\u003eunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\u003cbr\u003emodification of the work for the customer\u0026#39;s own use and reverse\u003cbr\u003eengineering for debugging such modifications.\u003cbr\u003eYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\u003cbr\u003ethis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\u003cbr\u003eduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\u003cbr\u003ecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\u003cbr\u003edirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\u003cbr\u003eof these things:\u003cbr\u003ea) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\u003cbr\u003emachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\u003cbr\u003echanges were used in the work (which must be distributed under\u003cbr\u003eSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\u003cbr\u003ewith the Library, with the complete machine-readable \u0026quot;work that\u003cbr\u003euses the Library\u0026quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the\u003cbr\u003euser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\u003cbr\u003eexecutable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\u003cbr\u003ethat the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\u003cbr\u003eto use the modified definitions.)\u003cbr\u003eb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\u003cbr\u003ecopy of the library already present on the user\u0026#39;s computer system,\u003cbr\u003erather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\u003cbr\u003ewill operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\u003cbr\u003ethe user installs one, as long as the modified version is\u003cbr\u003einterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\u003cbr\u003ec) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\u003cbr\u003eleast three years, to give the same user the materials\u003cbr\u003especified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\u003cbr\u003ethan the cost of performing this distribution.\u003cbr\u003ed) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\u003cbr\u003efrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\u003cbr\u003especified materials from the same place.\u003cbr\u003ee) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\u003cbr\u003ematerials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\u003cbr\u003eFor an executable, the required form of the \u0026quot;work that uses the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary\u0026quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for\u003cbr\u003ereproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\u003cbr\u003ethe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\u003cbr\u003enormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\u003cbr\u003ecomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\u003cbr\u003ewhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\u003cbr\u003ethe executable.\u003cbr\u003eIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\u003cbr\u003erestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\u003cbr\u003eaccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\u003cbr\u003euse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\u003cbr\u003edistribute.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\u003cbr\u003efacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\u003cbr\u003elibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\u003cbr\u003ethe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\u003cbr\u003epermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\u003cbr\u003ea) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\u003cbr\u003ebased on the Library, uncombined with any other library\u003cbr\u003efacilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\u003cbr\u003eSections above.\u003cbr\u003eb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\u003cbr\u003ethat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\u003cbr\u003ewhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\u003cbr\u003e8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\u003cbr\u003ethe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\u003cbr\u003eattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\u003cbr\u003erights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\u003cbr\u003eor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\u003cbr\u003eterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\u003cbr\u003e9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\u003cbr\u003esigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\u003cbr\u003edistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\u003cbr\u003eprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\u003cbr\u003emodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\u003cbr\u003eall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\u003cbr\u003ethe Library or works based on it.\u003cbr\u003e10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\u003cbr\u003eLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\u003cbr\u003esubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\u003cbr\u003erestrictions on the recipients\u0026#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\u003cbr\u003eYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\u003cbr\u003ethis License.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\u003cbr\u003einfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\u003cbr\u003econditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\u003cbr\u003eotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\u003cbr\u003eexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\u003cbr\u003edistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\u003cbr\u003eLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\u003cbr\u003emay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\u003cbr\u003elicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\u003cbr\u003eall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\u003cbr\u003ethe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\u003cbr\u003erefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\u003cbr\u003eIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\u003cbr\u003eparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\u003cbr\u003eand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\u003cbr\u003eIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\u003cbr\u003epatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\u003cbr\u003esuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\u003cbr\u003eintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\u003cbr\u003eimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\u003cbr\u003egenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\u003cbr\u003ethrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\u003cbr\u003esystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\u003cbr\u003eto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\u003cbr\u003eimpose that choice.\u003cbr\u003eThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\u003cbr\u003ebe a consequence of the rest of this License.\u003cbr\u003e12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\u003cbr\u003ecertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\u003cbr\u003eoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\u003cbr\u003ean explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\u003cbr\u003eso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\u003cbr\u003eexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\u003cbr\u003ewritten in the body of this License.\u003cbr\u003e13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\u003cbr\u003eversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\u003cbr\u003eSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\u003cbr\u003ebut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\u003cbr\u003eEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\u003cbr\u003especifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\u003cbr\u003e\u0026quot;any later version\u0026quot;, you have the option of following the terms and\u003cbr\u003econditions either of that version or of any later version published by\u003cbr\u003ethe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\u003cbr\u003elicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\u003cbr\u003ethe Free Software Foundation.\u003cbr\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\u003cbr\u003eprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\u003cbr\u003ewrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\u003cbr\u003ecopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\u003cbr\u003eSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\u003cbr\u003edecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\u003cbr\u003eof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\u003cbr\u003eand reuse of software generally.\u003cbr\u003eNO WARRANTY\u003cbr\u003e15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\u003cbr\u003eWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\u003cbr\u003eEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\u003cbr\u003eOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \u0026quot;AS IS\u0026quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\u003cbr\u003eKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\u003cbr\u003eIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\u003cbr\u003ePURPOSE.
