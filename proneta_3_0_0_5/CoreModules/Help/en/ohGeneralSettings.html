                    “Automatically assign temporary device names”:<br>
                    Checking either entry will ensure that all devices which
                    are found during a network scan will automatically have valid IP addresses
                    and/or device names assigned to them. The IP addresses will be taken from the
                    subnet defined by “Subnet network IP address”, and the devices will receive the
                    subnet mask from the respective field.<br>
                    IP addresses and device names are lost when the respective device is powered
                    off.

                    network automatically (scanner continually runs)”:<br>
                    If this entry is checked, the scanner will be permanently active, unless
                    specifically stopped. This will result in a constantly up-to-date
                    representation of the physical network, but will also create higher traffic
                    loads and may lead to problems with time-critical communications on the
                    network.<br>
                    To stop the scanner, use the <span lang="DE"><a href="ohOnlineMode.html#olScannerStatusIndicator"><span lang="EN-US">Scanner Status Indicator</span></a></span>’s context menu.

                    A PLC may provide additional “Identification and maintenance data”, like order

                    PRONETA Basic can also poll the network for devices which do not support the full PROFINET standard. “Scan IP addresses from … to” gives the range of network addresses that PRONETA Basic will poll for these devices.
                    Using this option and giving large address ranges may result in higher response times of PRONETA Basic and increased network load.

                <li>
                    “Maximum load generated by the scan process”:<br>
                    This slider lets you set an upper limit for the bandwidth used by PRONETA Basic’s network scan. Large traffic values may have a negative impact on the general communication, but will also lead to shorter update cycles.
                    Reduce this value if you experience general communication problems on your network due to PRONETA Basic’s scans.
